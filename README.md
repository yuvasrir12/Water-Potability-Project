# Water-Potability-Project
This project uses machine learning techniques to classify whether water is safe for human consumption based on several physical and chemical features. The model helps in predicting water potability, aiding in efficient water quality monitoring and public health protection.
# Project Overview
The objective of this project is to develop a classification model that predicts the potability of water using a dataset that includes water quality indicators such as:
1) pH
2) Hardness
3) Solids
4) Chloramines
5) Sulfate
6) Conductivity
7) Organic Carbon
8) Trihalomethanes
9) Turbidity
# Dataset
The dataset contains water quality samples labeled as:

-Potable (1) – Safe for drinking

-Not Potable (0) – Unsafe for drinking
